<li>Main issue: Man re-/learns what pop music is</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Complaint: POP music is starting to sound very "same-y"
<ol>
<li>homogenoues; relient on gimicks, melodic structures</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cheap music made as content (wtf?)</li>
<li>Has modern music gotten worse of is he old? (he is)</li>
<li>Streaming services pay same rate (more or less)
<ol>
<li>competition in music industry (no shit)</li>
<li>songs getting shorter</li>
<li>"People want songs that are short and catchy"</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Problem: short music that is all pretty much the same
<ol>
<li>streaming has "shifted from art to content" (oof this aint new)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ROOT PROBLEM: Curation Playlists
<ol>
<li>very difficult to get into crutation playlists (NO SHIT)</li>
<li>artists have incentive to create music that fits curation parameters (AGAIN, NO. SHIT.)
<ol>
<li>length, structure, melodic content, mood, tempo, instrumentation</li>
<li>homogenouszation b/c "diversity and creative experimentation aren't incouraged" <code>really though, does this guy not know about history of music industry?</code></li>
<li>"incentiviesed to create things that sound more or less the same" (<em>its called pop music for a reason bro</em>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>idk where we're at here i just needed a seperate bulletpoint
<ol>
<li>guy just shit on artists for doing bar gigs cuz he just wants to have a beer.
<ol>
<li>there's more nuance to this actually but i still think this idea is dumb
<ol>
<li>no one owes an artist anything just cuz they put their heart and soul into their music. (at the same time, go somewhere else if the bar is having a show. idk am i being unreasonable here</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>he kind of reduces anyone who doesn't listen to music for the "heart and soul" of it to being simpleminded that "don't care and just wanna listen to music"</li>
<li>"experimentating is risky"<br />
&gt; <strong>NO SHIT SHERLOCK</strong></li>
<li>"This isn't meant as an elietist tirade on popular music on streaming services"
<ol>
<li>(i think this guy is just thinking about it all wrong)<br />
IDK what im doing with the numbering anymore. none of it makes sense so i'll stop</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>"most people don't know what they want until you give it to them"
<ul>
<li>YES finally we agree on something</li>
